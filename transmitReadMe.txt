Here  we  have  two  files  for  each  program  (e.g.,  transmit.c  and  bit_manipulation.c).
Compiling the program will be as follows:
gcc â€“o tran transmit.c bit_manipulation.c

To start  the  transmit  program enter:
./tran

The program will prompt the user to enter a message. The 
program will then print the transmitted message as a sequence of short integers.
