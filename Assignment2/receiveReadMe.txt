Here  we  have  two  files  for  each  program  (e.g.,  receive.c  and  bit_manipulation.c).
Compiling the program will be as follows:
gcc â€“o recv receive.c bit_manipulation.c

To start the recieve program enter:
./recv

Start  the  receive  message.  The  program  will  prompt  the  user  to  enter  the  transmitted 
message.    Here  you  will  have  to  copy  the  output  from  transmit  program.    The  program 
should output the uncorrected transmitted message and the corrected message.
